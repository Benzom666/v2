                grant free Memberships to whomever and whenever we want, and we
                can cancel any free trial periods when we want.

            your use of the Service after such posting will constitute acceptance
            by You of the revised Agreement. If You are a subscribing Member at

            then-existing Agreement will continue to govern your Membership until
            such time that your Membership is renewed (whether by You or
            automatically by the Service) as contemplated herein. If You continue
            your Membership, your renewal will constitute acceptance by You of the
            revised Agreement. Alternatively, if You terminate your subscription
